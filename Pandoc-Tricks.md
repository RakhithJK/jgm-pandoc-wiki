sight.

# From Markdown, To Markdown

using `pandoc -f markdown... -t markdown...` can have surprisingly
useful applications. As a demo, this file is generated by

``` bash
pandoc -f gfm -t gfm --atx-headers \
     --reference-location=block --toc -s -o temp-github.md temp.md
```

Be careful of `@` though, you need to escape it in pandoc since it is
treated as citation in pandoc.

## Cleanup

As shown in issue [#2814](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/2814),
rendering a document to itself can be used to clean up / normalize your
markdown file.

## TOC generation

*e.g.* you have a long markdown file in GitHub and want to have a TOC,
you can use `pandoc -s -t gfm --toc -o example-with-toc.md example.md`

This a useful workaround to update the TOC of very long documents, but—beware!—if
you use this trick for writing over the input file,
you’ll end stacking TOCs—each new Table of Contents being generated
above the previously built ones, and indexing them too. This technique
is useful when working with different source and output files.

Also, you can add a title to the TOC using the `toc-title` variable, but
only if you use a markdown template — as explained ahead.

## Using Markdown Templates

Did you know that you can use pandoc template with markdown too?

Ask pandoc to write-out the default template for markdown:

``` bash
pandoc --print-default-template=markdown > template.markdown
```

And now let’s peek at the template we got:

    $if(titleblock)$
    $titleblock$
    
    $endif$
    $for(header-includes)$
    $header-includes$
    
    $endfor$
    $for(include-before)$
    $include-before$
    
    $endfor$
    $if(toc)$
    $toc$
    
    $endif$
    $body$
    $for(include-after)$
    
    $include-after$
    $endfor$

As you can see, there’s plenty of conditional statements to play with,
allowing for additional control over the output markdown file.

You can also use the `toc-title` template variable to tell pandoc to add
a title on top of the generated TOC. Change the template’s `toc` block
like this:

    $if(toc)$
    $if(toc-title)$
    # $toc-title$
    $endif$
    
    $toc$
    
    $endif$

And now invoke pandoc like this:

``` bash
pandoc --toc -V toc-title:"Table of Contents" --template=template.markdown -o example-with-toc.md example.md
```

And you’ll see in the `example-with-toc.md` file an auto-generated Table
of Contents with a `# Table of Contents` title over it.

> **NOTE**: if you also include some extra markdown contents with the
> `--include-before-body` option (eg:
> `--include-before-body=somefile.md`) the contents of the included file
> will go before the TOC (at least, with the template used in this
> example) and any headings it contains will not be included in the TOC
> — ie: the TOC only indexes what comes after the `$toc$` template
> tag. This is useful if you’d like to include an Abstract before the
> TOC.

## Math in Pure Markdown

The manual said:

> Note: the `--webtex` option will affect Markdown output as well as
> HTML.

This can be used to put math in pure markdown. *e.g.* you want to put
math directly in the README.md in GitHub.

For example, in the `temp.md`:

``` markdown
# Important Discovery!

$1+2\neq3!$

Try it!
```

Run this:

``` bash
pandoc --atx-headers --webtex=https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex? -s -o temp-codecogs.md temp.md
```

Then the output becomes:

> # Important Discovery!
> 
> ![1+2\\neq3\!](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?1%2B2%5Cneq3%21
> "1+2\\neq3!")
> 
> Try it!

## Convert Between the 4 Table Syntaxes in Pandoc

Say, in your source markdown file `pipe.md`:

``` markdown
| testing     | pandoc            | tables  |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| simple cell | no multiline cell | and     |
| so          | on                | no list |
```

In command line,

``` bash
pandoc -t markdown-simple_tables-multiline_tables-pipe_tables -s -o grid.md pipe.md
```

In the output `grid.md`:

``` markdown
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| testing                  | pandoc                   | tables                   |
+==========================+==========================+==========================+
| simple cell              | no multiline cell        | and                      |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| so                       | on                       | no list                  |
+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
```

## Repeated Footnotes Anchors and Headers Across Multiple Files

If you use auto-identifiers for the headers, and there are different
headers with the same name across different files, you’d want to
catenate them together, and pandoc can do this for you:

``` bash
pandoc file1.md file2.md ...
```

But if there are repeated footnotes anchors on both files, you need to
use the `--file-scope` option, which will parse each file individually
(so the footnotes anchors are “local” to the individual file):

``` bash
pandoc file1.md file2.md --file-scope ...
```

What about if the 2 files have both these problems? i.e., headers with
same names (hence the same Id by the auto-identifier) and footnotes with
same anchors appear across the files. Either approach gives you
problems.

In this case, you can use “to markdown from markdown” to write an
intermediate markdown file using `--file-scope`, which handles the
colliding footnote anchors for you, and then generate the final document
from that intermediate markdown file, and let the auto-identifiers
handle the headers for you:

``` bash
pandoc --file-scope -o intermediate.md file1.md file2.md
pandoc intermediate.md ...
```

# Template Snippet

If you wrote a template snippet that do not form a complete template.
The `-H`, `-B`, or `-A` option would not help because pandoc would put
your snippet as is and wouldn’t process it as a template. *i.e.* The
snippet is included after the template is processed.

A trick mentioned by [@cagix](https://github.com/cagix) in
[jgm/pandoc-templates#220](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/issues/220)
is this:

``` bash
pandoc --template=template_snippet.tex document.md -o processed_snippet
pandoc ... -H processed_snippet document.md -o document.<toFormat>
# Or shorter but bash only (process substitution)
SNIPPET=template_snippet.tex; INPUT=document.md; OUTPUT=document.<toFormat>
pandoc ... -H <(pandoc --template=$SNIPPET $INPUT) $INPUT -o $OUTPUT
```

The first line will process your template snippet according to the
properties of the document, but since your snippet (probably) do not
have `$body$`, the body would not be in the output. Now the snippet is
processed and can then be included through `-H` as is in the 2nd line.

# YAML Metadata for Any Format

YAML metadata is only defined for pandoc’s markdown syntax. See
[jgm/pandoc#1960](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1960#issuecomment-273587588).

Currently, there is a workaround like this (while the YAML metadata only
accepts markdown syntax):

``` bash
pandoc -f markdown -t native -s metadata.yml | sed '$ d' > metadata.native
pandoc -t native -o document.native document.<fromFormat>
pandoc -f native -s -o document.<toFormat> metadata.native document.native
# Or shorter but bash only (process substitution)
YAML=metadata.yml; INPUT=document.<fromFormat>; OUTPUT=document.<toFormat>
pandoc ... -f native -s -o $OUTPUT <(pandoc -f markdown -t native -s $YAML | sed '$ d') <(pandoc -t native $INPUT)
```

Explanation:

The `sed` in the first line: because the `metadata.yml` is regarding as
a markdown document with no body, so the last line of the metadata in
native format is `[]`, which you need to remove. Another way of removing
it is `head -n -1` (would not work on Mac’s default `head`). From my
test it seems the meta in native is always in one-line, if true then
`head -n1` will work (which also works on Mac).

# Left-aligning Tables in LaTeX

Based on [this pandoc-discuss
exchange](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pandoc-discuss/pmiw78NvZl4)
and [this TeX StackExchange
topic](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/6456/set-a-global-policy-for-floats-positioning),
it is possible to left-align all tables in a document (in the PDF output
from LaTeX) with this single invocation in the YAML header block of the
markdown document:

```` yaml
---
header-includes:
  - |
    ```{=latex}
    \usepackage[margins=raggedright]{floatrow}
    ```
...
````

This applies to all floats, and fine-grained control may be achieved
with the options outlined in [the documentation for the `floatrow` LaTeX
package](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/floatrow/floatrow.pdf).

# GFM Task Lists with Pandoc

Task lists are part of pandoc as of v2.6. Syntax is the same as GFM.

# Today in date metadata

Add this to the pandoc command you use:

    -M date="$(date "+%B %e, %Y")"

POSIX only.

# Definition list terms on their own line in LaTeX

Most tools, including most Web browsers render definition lists with the (first) definition on a separate, indented line below the term:

````text
Term

  Definition A.
  Second line of definition.
  
  Definition B.
````

LaTeX instead sets the term in bold and the first definition run-in on the same line, which doesn't look good if you have space between paragraphs as Pandoc does:

````text
**Term**  Definition A.
  Second line of definition.
  
  Definition B.
````

It is easy to fix this without loading any extra package. Just make sure the following is in your LaTeX preamble:

````latex
% "Clone" the original \item command
\let\originalitem\item

% Redefine the \item command using the "clone"
\makeatletter
\renewcommand{\item}[1][\@nil]{%
    \def\tmp{#1}%
    \ifx\tmp\@nnil\originalitem\else\originalitem[#1]\hfill\par\fi}
\makeatother
````

This still leaves the term in boldface. To get the term in the normal typeface change the invocation of `\originalitem[#1]` to

````latex
\originalitem[\textnormal{#1}]
````

Put this in your custom template or add a `header-includes` field to your document metadata:

````````yaml
---
header-includes:
  - |
    ````{=latex}
    % insert the fix here
    ````
````````

# Level 4 and 5 headings on their own line in LaTeX

In LaTeX level 4 headings are rendered with the `\paragraph` command and level 5 headings are rendered with the `\subparagraph` command.  These commands set the (first) paragraph after the heading run-in with the heading.  There is an easy way to fix this. Make sure to include the following in your LaTeX preamble:

````latex
% Make "clones" of the commands
\let\originalparagraph\paragraph
\let\originalsubparagraph\subparagraph

% Redefine the commands using the "clones"
\renewcommand{\paragraph}[1]%
{\originalparagraph{#1}\hfill}
\renewcommand{\subparagraph}[1]%
{\originalsubparagraph{#1}\hfill}
````

Note that unlike [the similar fix for definition list terms](#definition-list-terms-on-their-own-line-in-latex) there should *not* be any `\par` after the `\hfill` here!
