# Web Services to Process Files by Pandoc

- [Docverter](http://www.docverter.com)
- [Pandoc online](https://foliovision.com/seo-tools/pandoc-online)
- [Pandoc as a service](https://github.com/mrded/pandoc-as-a-service "GitHub source files for running service locally, by Dmitry Demenchuk. Original online service no longer available"): Serving on localhost. (See also: [WaybackMachine](https://web.archive.org/web/20150919182811/http://pandoc-as-a-service.com/ "Archived copy of the original online service by Dmitry Demenchuk"))
- [Markup.rocks](http://markup.rocks) runs a version of pandoc compiled to javascript via ghcjs. Conversion takes place client-side, in the browser, and a live preview of the result is available.

# Workflow

- [panzer](https://github.com/msprev/panzer), adds the concept of 'styles' to pandoc. Styles control templates, metadata settings, pandoc command line options, and instructions to run filters and pre/postprocessors in a simple, reusable, and recombinable way.
- [panrun](https://github.com/mb21/panrun): minimal script that runs pandoc with the options it finds in the YAML metadata of the input file.
- [kokoi](https://github.com/zeis/kokoi), a configurable markup file watcher, previewer, and converter that uses Pandoc as the default markup processing engine. _kokoi_ watches for changes on the markup files in the directory _kokoi_ is started, and if they change, automatically reprocesses and previews them directly in the browser.
- [pdc](https://github.com/bk/pdc) is a command line wrapper for pandoc which makes it possible to completely control the conversion process from the first YAML meta block in the input document(s), including multiple output formats at the same time, templates, pre- and post-processors, etc.
- [Pandocomatic](https://heerdebeer.org/Software/markdown/pandocomatic/), allows you to configure flexible YAML templates that control Pandoc settings, filters, metadata and pre/postprocessing. Applied to a directory, pandocomatic can act as a static site generator.
- [Pandoc Build Task](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PandocTasks/), a small MSBuild target to transform files with Pandoc. Provided as a Nuget package.
- [pandoc-schemata](https://github.com/rakali/pandoc-schemata), providing JSON Schema files for Pandoc JSON.
- [pandocket](https://github.com/wcaleb/pandocket), 'A python script that looks for special lines in a markdown file and uses those lines to convert, clean up, and insert content from URLs into the file for processing by pandoc'
- [fish-completion-pandoc](https://github.com/dsanson/fish-completion-pandoc), a pandoc completion script for use with the fish shell.
- [Pandoctools](https://github.com/kiwi0fruit/pandoctools) is a set of tools for writing reproducible Markdown reports. They rely on Pandoc and Jupyter kernels. At it's core is a profile manager of text processing pipelines (crossplatform bash scripts) that define chain operations over text (Pandoc filters, any text CLI filters).
- [bookbuildeR](https://github.com/thomasWeise/bookbuildeR) is a tool chain for compiling e-books from pandoc flavored Markdown to pdf, epub, html, and azw3, which also comes as a docker container and can also be used via online continuous integration tools such as Travis CI to automatically compile books whose sources are hosted on GitHub upon commits and automatically publish the results to GitHub pages. It also supports separating book sources in one repository and example program codes into another one, which is suitable for computer science books.
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a workflow automation tool (CI/CD) from GitHub.
  You can run pandoc on GitHub Actions on every push (or other GitHub event) to, for example, convert a source document to another markup and publish the results.
  There are two approaches to make pandoc available on GitHub Actions:
  1. You can [reference container actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#referencing-a-container-on-docker-hub) based on the [official docker pandoc images](https://github.com/pandoc/dockerfiles) in your GitHub Actions workflows.
    To learn how to set this up, see [these examples](https://github.com/maxheld83/pandoc-action-example).
  2. If, instead, you want to install pandoc on the host machine *directly*, you can use thus [setup-pandoc](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/setup-pandoc).
    This may take longer and does not offer the encapsulation of the docker images, but makes pandoc available in all steps, or even in different versions for matrix builds.

## Preprocessors

- [PP - A generic Preprocessor (with Pandoc in mind)](http://cdsoft.fr/pp/) lets you embed the following diagrams in Markdown code blocks:
    + [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) (needs to be installed separately)
    + [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) (embedded in pp at compile time)
    + [Ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/) (embedded in pp at compile time)
    + [Asymptote](http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) figures
    
    and offers many powerful features to expand pandoc power:
    
    + built-in macros
    + custom macros definition
    + literate programming
    + usage of [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Cmd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe), [PowerShell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) scripts (inline or external)

- [pancritic - using CriticMarkup with pandoc](https://github.com/ickc/pancritic)

    pancritic parses [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com/) in pandoc as a wrapper or preprocessor.
    CriticMarkup is an in-place diff format, while `pancritic` applies/resolves the indicated diffs.
    It supports HTML and LaTeX outputs.

### Legacy

- (included in PP) [Using GPP as a preprocessor](https://adityam.github.io/context-blog/post/markdown-with-gpp/) to get TeX-like macro features in Markdown.

- (included in PP) [mddia](https://github.com/nichtich/ditaa-markdown/) lets you embed [ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/) ASCII-art diagrams in Markdown code blocks
