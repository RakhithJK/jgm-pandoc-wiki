# This Is The Most Important Heading #

Be sure to read William James, _The Varieties of Religious Experience_.

James's book will **definitely** be covered on the final exam.

You must be able to discuss James's definition of religion:

> Religion, therefore, as I now ask you arbitrarily to take it, shall
> mean for us the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in
> their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in
> relation to whatever they may consider the divine.

James's book is available in full text at Google Books <http://books.google.com/books?id=OESbXvtUkIsC>.
